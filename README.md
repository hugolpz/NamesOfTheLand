# NamesOfTheLand

**NamesOfTheLand** uses citizen-created maps to put regional and endangered languages back upon their territories. We therefore showcast the traditional names of the land, questioning the visitor and the comunity on their current naming usage of their territories. 

## Background
This project has been initiated by Gascon, a subgroup of the Occitan people. A lively language family with about 15 millions speakers around 1900, this practice was mostly disapeared following sustained monolingualist French policies. Today, rare elders and few younger people support its conservation and modest revitalisation. We want to remember, hear, pronunce the native names of our villages, our mountains, our plains, rivers and modest lakes. We wish to share these calls, voices, whistles with our gone grand parents. We these ancient sounds waves of our land, we connect back with generations and generations of our ancestors living accross these landscapes they knew and cared for for centuries.
